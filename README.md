# Hey I'm Chris
## Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by electronics, constantly taking them apart to understand their inner workings. This curiosity led me to the world of coding, where I now thrive on creating and enhancing innovative projects. As a Computer Science major at Arizona State University, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. In my free time, you can find me rock climbing or playing the piano, which keep me balanced and inspired. Let's build something amazing together!
